# get_next_line

Summary: The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line ending with a newline, read from a file descriptor.

- Calling your function get_next_line in a loop will then allow you to read the text available on a file descriptor one line at a time until the EOF.

- Your program must compile with the flag -D BUFFER_SIZE=xx. which will be used as the buffer size for the read calls in your get_next_line.
